**Motivation and background ** : 
     
    With growing technology there is an increase in the automation of vehicles​

Vehicles can now be controlled remotely through advanced IOT networks ​

Voice control is one feature the companies today are trying to  implement in automobile automation​

This project focuses on vehicles that are controlled through the voice of Human​


**Methodology** :
  This  project uses an android app to convert the users voice commands into text commands  which is sent to the Arduino via Bluetooth .​

The Arduino controls the motors on the car through a motor driver with the help of text commands received by Bluetooth module on Arduino via Bluetooth .​

The Arduino is also connected to ultrasonic sensor and IR sensor which help in obstacle detection .​

If the sensors detect an obstacle during turnings or while moving forward and backward the car immediately stops to avoid collision
